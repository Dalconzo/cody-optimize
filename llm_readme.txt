1. Dependency Graph Generator
This tool would analyze import statements and function calls to create a visual representation of how different modules and functions depend on each other. For LLMs, this provides critical context about code relationships that might not be apparent from individual files.

python dependency_graph.py ./my_project --output-format=dot,json

2. Docstring and Comment Extractor
A specialized tool that pulls out natural language explanations from code comments and docstrings. This would help LLMs understand the developer's intent and domain-specific knowledge embedded in the codebase.

python extract_documentation.py ./my_project --include-inline-comments

Copy

Execute

3. Code Change Analyzer
This would compare two versions of a codebase and provide a structured representation of what changed, focusing on semantic changes rather than just textual diffs. This would be valuable for prompting LLMs about code evolution and reasoning about changes.

python code_diff.py ./project_v1 ./project_v2 --semantic-grouping

Copy

Execute

4. API Usage Extractor
A tool that identifies how external libraries and APIs are used throughout a codebase. This provides LLMs with patterns of usage that can inform better code suggestions.

python api_usage.py ./my_project --frameworks=react,tensorflow

Copy

Execute

5. Type Inference Tool
For dynamically typed languages, a tool that infers and documents the likely types used in functions and variables. This would enhance LLM understanding of code semantics even without explicit type annotations.

python infer_types.py ./my_python_project

Copy

Execute

6. Test-Code Relationship Mapper
Maps test files to their corresponding implementation files, extracting test cases and expected behaviors. This gives LLMs insight into the intended behavior of code.

python test_mapper.py ./my_project --test-dirs=tests,spec

Copy

Execute

7. Prompt Template Generator
A meta-tool that analyzes a codebase and automatically generates effective prompt templates for common operations like bug fixing, feature addition, or refactoring specific to that codebase.

python generate_prompts.py ./my_project --scenario=bug-fixing,refactoring

Copy

Execute

8. Code Complexity Visualizer
Extracts cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and other metrics that help LLMs identify which parts of the code might need simplification or explanation.

python complexity_map.py ./my_project --metrics=cyclomatic,cognitive,nesting

Copy

Execute

These tools would transform raw code into structured representations that highlight specific aspects LLMs need to perform higher-quality code analysis, generation, and transformation tasks. The key insight is that preprocessing code into formats that emphasize relationships, semantics, and natural language elements makes LLMs significantly more effective at understanding and working with complex codebases.
